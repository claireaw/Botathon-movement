# Botathon-movement

Created in a hurry for the third Botathon, this code is extremely quick.

Using mecanum wheels, this code allows the robot to move via the cardinal directions as well as rotate cw and ccw.

# Future improvements

*Reformat code to use functions instead of looping if statements.

*Fix JSON so that bumper inputs and multiple simultaneous inputs can be used.

*Fix bugs with existing inputs (these bugs will likelybe fixed when migrated to using functions, but some may persist afterwards).
